*Hey hey!*  
This is a recipe calculator for the SULFUR game wiki (**NOT OFFICIAL** I'm just a random stranger of the internet)  
It was made because I was tired of manually checking what new recipes I could craft with all my ingredients. ~~`hording issues`~~  




- **What it does:**  
Shows you what recipes you can make with your current ingredients  
**Visual inventory grid** (because why not make it fancy at 2am?)  
Lets you **favorite** ingredients and recipes  
Auto-updates as you add/remove stuff  
**Export/import** your favorites  
Game-style tooltips and UI that actually looks nice  

- **How to use:**  
Install a userscript manager (I use Violentmonkey on Firefox)  
Install the script from GreasyFork or copy paste it from anywhere else.   
But I'll be updating the one on GreasyFork (and here) with changes if something catchs on fire  
**RESTART YOUR BROWSER** (important, especially Chrome users!) Just let go of Chrome, you deserve better!  
Go to sulfur.wiki.gg and look for the "Recipe Calculator" button on the top right of the page  

- **Tested:**  
  - Firefox + Violentmonkey (what I developed it on)  
  - Chrome + Tampermonkey (needs restart)  
  - Edge + Violentmonkey (needs restart)  
(just restart all of them)  

- **Should work but untested:**  
  - Most other browser + userscript manager combos  
  - Just avoid Greasemonkey (old API, breaks some images)  

- **Notes:**  
I can only confirm that it works on Windows 10 (that's all I tested on)    
The Nut Mix recipe can $#!*-/?`  
Made with questionable life choices at 3 AM  
Uses "toothpicks and ducktape" but hey, it works!  
Free to use, modify, steal, whatever it's yours now!  

- **Credits:**  
Caffeine addiction  
Deepseek senpai (I'm still learning this code thingie)  
The SULFUR community for being pretty cool!  

All image links are directly from the official wiki!  
I don't own or am associated with anything in relation to SULFUR the game or the wiki. I just ~~stole~~ **borrowed** the links for the images.  
If you're a dev and you don't want this tool, just let me know and it will mysteriously disappear.    
Do you want to modify this? Take it and tell your friends you made it? Go ahead! It's free to use for everyone and anyone!  
Found a bug? Damn, have you tried turning it off and on? Open an issue and I'll fix it... eventually, one day, probably, maybe
